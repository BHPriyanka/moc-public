# Massachusetts Open Cloud 

Welcome to the main repository for the [Mass Open Cloud][web]!
Below you will find several projects discussing various aspects of
what we are doing.

## Our people

We are a friendly bunch of folks with a variety of backgrounds. See
a list of us [here][people]!

## Current projects
* [Hardware As A Service](https://github.com/CCI-MOC/haas) (HaaS):
  securely automating the provisioning and isolation of systems and
  networks in a multi-tenant data center
* Openstack UI:
  * adding extensions to Openstack's Horizon in order to
    accommodate a multi-provider marketplace
  * introducing a "simple" mode for Horizon to support easy
    deployment and management of VMs
* Openstack core: Adding the capability to handle multiple providers
  of individual services (like compute, object storage, etc)

## Documentation

Documentation for the various MOC projects lives on Github in one of
three places:

1. Projects having their own git repo will store longer-lived
   documentation (like design docs) within their own docs directory.
2. Longer-lived documents that do not pertain to a particular
   project under the CCI-MOC account will be placed in the
   [moc-public repo](https://github.com/CCI-MOC/moc-public). This
   could include things like design documents for functionality in
   repos that are not owned by MOC or papers.
3. Items that are less formal by nature (like [meeting minutes][mm],
   [random notes][rn], or [project planning][pp]) are kept on the
   [MOC Public Wiki](https://github.com/CCI-MOC/moc-public/wiki)
