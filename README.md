# Massachusetts Open Cloud 

Welcome to the main repository for the [Mass Open Cloud](http://massopencloud.org)! You will find several projects discussing various aspects of what we are doing.

## Our people
We are a friendly bunch of folks with a variety of backgrounds.

See a list of us [here](http://www.bu.edu/cci/moc/mocpeople/)!

## Current projects
* [Hardware As A Service](https://github.com/CCI-MOC/haas) (HaaS): securely automating the provisioning and isolation of systems and networks in a multi-tenant data center.
* Openstack UI: adding extensions to Openstack's Horizon in order to accomodate a multi-provider marketplace.
* Openstack UI: Introducing a "simple" mode for Horizon to support easy deployment and management of VMs
* Openstack core: Adding the capability to handle multiple providers of individual services (like compute, object storage, etc)

## Documentation
Documentation for the various MOC projects lives on github in one of three places:
1. Projects having their own git repo will store longer-lived documentation (like design docs) within their own docs directory.
1. Longer-lived documents that do not pertain to a particular project under the CCI-MOC account will be placed in the the [moc-public repo](https://github.com/CCI-MOC/moc-public). This could include things like design documents for functionality in repos that are not owned by MOC or papers.
1. Items that are less formal by nature (like [meeting minutes](https://github.com/CCI-MOC/moc-public/wiki), [random notes](https://github.com/CCI-MOC/moc-public/wiki/OpenStack-Notes), or [project planning](https://github.com/CCI-MOC/moc-public/wiki/Current-tasks)) are kept on the [MOC Public Wiki](https://github.com/CCI-MOC/moc-public/wiki)
